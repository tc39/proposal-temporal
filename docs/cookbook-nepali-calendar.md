# Nepali calendar

Support for the Nepali calendar is currently not built in to JS
environments.
This example shows how to implement a custom calendar with Temporal, by
creating a date class for that calendar that works like PlainDate and
can be used as a PlainDate property bag.

```javascript
{{cookbook/nepaliCalendar.mjs}}
```
