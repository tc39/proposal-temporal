## Introduction

`Date` has been a long-standing pain point in ECMAScript.
This is a proposal for `Temporal`, a global `Object` that acts as a top-level namespace (like `Math`), that brings a modern date/time API to the ECMAScript language.
For a detailed look at some of the problems with `Date`, and the motivations for Temporal, see:
[Fixing JavaScript Date](https://maggiepint.com/2017/04/09/fixing-javascript-date-getting-started/).

Temporal fixes these problems by:

- Providing easy-to-use APIs for date and time computations
- First-class support for all time zones, including DST-safe arithmetic
- Dealing only with objects representing fixed dates and times
- Parsing a strictly specified string format
- Supporting non-Gregorian calendars

Temporal provides separate ECMAScript classes for date-only, time-only, and other scoped use cases. This makes code more readable and prevents bugs caused by incorrectly assuming 0, UTC, or the local time zone for values that are actually unknown.

## Cookbook

A cookbook to help you get started and learn the ins and outs of Temporal is available [here](./cookbook.md).

## API Documentation

The Temporal API follows a convention of using types whose names start with "Plain" (like `Temporal.PlainDate`, `Temporal.PlainTime`, and `Temporal.PlainDateTime`) for objects which do not have an associated time zone.
Converting between such types and exact time types (`Temporal.Instant` and `Temporal.ZonedDateTime`) can be ambiguous because of time zones and daylight saving time, and the Temporal API lets developers configure how this ambiguity is resolved.

Several important concepts are explained elsewhere: [exact time, wall-clock time, time zones, DST, handling ambiguity, and more](./ambiguity.md).

### **Temporal.Now**

- `Temporal.Now.instant()` - get the current system exact time
- `Temporal.Now.timeZoneId()` - get the current system time zone
- `Temporal.Now.zonedDateTimeISO()` - get the current date and wall-clock time in the system time zone and ISO-8601 calendar
- `Temporal.Now.plainDateISO()` - get the current date in the system time zone and ISO-8601 calendar
- `Temporal.Now.plainTimeISO()` - get the current wall-clock time in the system time zone and ISO-8601 calendar
- `Temporal.Now.plainDateTimeISO()` - same as above, but return the DateTime in the ISO-8601 calendar

```js
console.log('Initialization complete', Temporal.Now.instant());
// example output:
// Initialization complete 2021-01-13T20:57:01.500944804Z
```

See [Temporal.Now Documentation](./now.md) for detailed documentation.

### **Temporal.Instant**

A `Temporal.Instant` represents a fixed point in time (called **"exact time"**), without regard to calendar or location, e.g. July 20, 1969, at 20:17 UTC.
For a human-readable local calendar date or clock time, use a `Temporal.TimeZone` and `Temporal.Calendar` to obtain a `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` or `Temporal.PlainDateTime`.

```js
const instant = Temporal.Instant.from('1969-07-20T20:17Z');
instant.toString(); // => '1969-07-20T20:17:00Z'
instant.epochMilliseconds; // => -14182980000
```

See [Temporal.Instant Documentation](./instant.md) for detailed documentation.

### **Temporal.ZonedDateTime**

A `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` is a timezone-aware, calendar-aware date/time object that represents a real event that has happened (or will happen) at a particular exact time from the perspective of a particular region on Earth, e.g. December 7th, 1995 at 3:24 AM in US Pacific time (in Gregorian calendar).
This type is optimized for use cases that require a time zone, including DST-safe arithmetic and interoperability with RFC 5545 (iCalendar).

```js
const zonedDateTime = Temporal.ZonedDateTime.from({
  timeZone: 'America/Los_Angeles',
  year: 1995,
  month: 12,
  day: 7,
  hour: 3,
  minute: 24,
  second: 30,
  millisecond: 0,
  microsecond: 3,
  nanosecond: 500
}); // => 1995-12-07T03:24:30.0000035-08:00[America/Los_Angeles]
```

As the broadest `Temporal` type, `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` can be considered a combination of `Temporal.TimeZone`, `Temporal.Instant`, and `Temporal.PlainDateTime` (which includes `Temporal.Calendar`).

See [Temporal.ZonedDateTime Documentation](./zoneddatetime.md) for detailed documentation.

### **Temporal.PlainDate**

A `Temporal.PlainDate` object represents a calendar date that is not associated with a particular time or time zone, e.g. August 24th, 2006.

```js
const date = Temporal.PlainDate.from({ year: 2006, month: 8, day: 24 }); // => 2006-08-24
date.year; // => 2006
date.inLeapYear; // => false
date.toString(); // => '2006-08-24'
```

This can also be converted to partial dates such as `Temporal.PlainYearMonth` and `Temporal.PlainMonthDay`.

See [Temporal.PlainDate Documentation](./plaindate.md) for detailed documentation.

### **Temporal.PlainTime**

A `Temporal.PlainTime` object represents a wall-clock time that is not associated with a particular date or time zone, e.g. 7:39 PM.

```js
const time = Temporal.PlainTime.from({
  hour: 19,
  minute: 39,
  second: 9,
  millisecond: 68,
  microsecond: 346,
  nanosecond: 205
}); // => 19:39:09.068346205

time.second; // => 9
time.toString(); // => '19:39:09.068346205'
```

See [Temporal.PlainTime Documentation](./plaintime.md) for detailed documentation.

### **Temporal.PlainDateTime**

A `Temporal.PlainDateTime` represents a calendar date and wall-clock time that does not carry time zone information, e.g. December 7th, 1995 at 3:00 PM (in the Gregorian calendar).

It can be converted to a `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` using a `Temporal.TimeZone`.
For use cases that require a time zone, especially using arithmetic or other derived values, consider using `Temporal.ZonedDateTime` instead because that type automatically adjusts for Daylight Saving Time.

```js
const dateTime = Temporal.PlainDateTime.from({
  year: 1995,
  month: 12,
  day: 7,
  hour: 15
}); // => 1995-12-07T15:00:00
const dateTime1 = dateTime.with({
  minute: 17,
  second: 19
}); // => 1995-12-07T15:17:19
```

See [Temporal.PlainDateTime Documentation](./plaindatetime.md) for detailed documentation.

### **Temporal.PlainYearMonth**

A date without a day component.
This is useful to express things like "the October 2020 meeting".

```js
const yearMonth = Temporal.PlainYearMonth.from({ year: 2020, month: 10 }); // => 2020-10
yearMonth.daysInMonth; // => 31
yearMonth.daysInYear; // => 366
```

See [Temporal.PlainYearMonth Documentation](./plainyearmonth.md) for detailed documentation.

### **Temporal.PlainMonthDay**

A date without a year component.
This is useful to express things like "Bastille Day is on the 14th of July".

```js
const monthDay = Temporal.PlainMonthDay.from({ month: 7, day: 14 }); // => 07-14
const date = monthDay.toPlainDate({ year: 2030 }); // => 2030-07-14
date.dayOfWeek; // => 7
```

See [Temporal.PlainMonthDay Documentation](./plainmonthday.md) for detailed documentation.

### **Temporal.Duration**

A `Temporal.Duration` expresses a length of time, e.g. 5 minutes and 30 seconds.
This is used for date/time arithmetic and for measuring differences between `Temporal` objects.

```js
const duration = Temporal.Duration.from({
  hours: 130,
  minutes: 20
});

duration.total({ unit: 'second' }); // => 469200
```

See [Temporal.Duration Documentation](./duration.md) for detailed documentation.

#### Balancing

Unlike the other Temporal types, the units in `Temporal.Duration` don't naturally wrap around to 0: you may want to have a duration of "90 minutes," and you don't want it to unexpectedly turn into "1 hour and 30 minutes."

See [Duration balancing](./balancing.md) for more on this topic.

### **Temporal.TimeZone**

A `Temporal.TimeZone` represents an IANA time zone, a specific UTC offset, or UTC itself.
Time zones translate from a date/time in UTC to a local date/time.
Because of this `Temporal.TimeZone` can be used to convert between `Temporal.Instant` and `Temporal.PlainDateTime` as well as finding out the offset at a specific `Temporal.Instant`.

It is also possible to implement your own time zones.

```js
const timeZone = Temporal.TimeZone.from('Africa/Cairo');
timeZone.getInstantFor('2000-01-01T00:00'); // => 1999-12-31T22:00:00Z
timeZone.getPlainDateTimeFor('2000-01-01T00:00Z'); // => 2000-01-01T02:00:00
timeZone.getPreviousTransition(Temporal.Now.instant()); // => 2014-09-25T21:00:00Z
timeZone.getNextTransition(Temporal.Now.instant()); // => null
```

See [Temporal.TimeZone Documentation](./timezone.md) for detailed documentation.
A conceptual explanation of handling [time zones, DST, and ambiguity in Temporal](./ambiguity.md) is also available.

### **Temporal.Calendar**

A `Temporal.Calendar` represents a calendar system.
Most code will use the ISO 8601 calendar, but other calendar systems are available.

Dates have associated `Temporal.Calendar` objects, to perform calendar-related math.
Under the hood, this math is done by methods on the calendars.

It is also possible to implement your own calendars.

```js
const cal = Temporal.Calendar.from('iso8601');
const date = cal.dateFromFields({ year: 1999, month: 12, day: 31 }, {});
date.monthsInYear; // => 12
date.daysInYear; // => 365
```

See [Temporal.Calendar Documentation](./calendar.md) for detailed documentation.

## String persistence, parsing, and formatting

All `Temporal` types have a string representation for persistence and interoperability.
The correspondence between types and machine-readable strings is shown below.
For more information about string parsing, serialization, and formatting in `Temporal` (including how Temporal is using industry standards like ISO 8601 and RFC 3339), see [String Parsing, Serialization, and Formatting](./strings.md).
