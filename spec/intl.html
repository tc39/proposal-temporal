      The String values used to identify locales, currencies, scripts, and time zones are interpreted in an ASCII-case-insensitive manner, treating the code units 0x0041 through 0x005A (corresponding to Unicode characters LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A through LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Z) as equivalent to the corresponding code units 0x0061 through 0x007A (corresponding to Unicode characters LATIN SMALL LETTER A through LATIN SMALL LETTER Z), both inclusive. No other case folding equivalences are applied.

    <emu-note>
      For example, *"ß"* (U+00DF) must not match or be mapped to *"SS"* (U+0053, U+0053). *"ı"* (U+0131) must not match or be mapped to *"I"* (U+0049).

    <h1>Use of the IANA Time Zone Database</h1>

    <emu-note type="editor">This section replaces the <a href="https://tc39.es/ecma-402/#sec-time-zone-names">Time Zone Names</a> section in ECMA-402.</emu-note>
    <p>
      Implementations that adopt this specification are time zone aware: they use the IANA Time Zone Database <a href="https://www.iana.org/time-zones/">https://www.iana.org/time-zones/</a> to supply time zone identifiers and data used in ECMAScript calculations and formatting.
      This section defines how the IANA Time Zone Database should be used by time zone aware implementations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Except as overridden by AvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifiers, each Zone in the IANA Time Zone Database must be a primary time zone identifier and each Link name in the IANA Time Zone Database must be a non-primary time zone identifier.
      No String may be an available named time zone identifier unless it is a Zone name or a Link name in the IANA Time Zone Database.
      Available named time zone identifiers returned by ECMAScript built-in objects must use the casing found in the IANA Time Zone Database.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the IANA Time Zone Database, the UTC time zone is represented by the Zone *"Etc/UTC"* which is distinct from the Zone *"Etc/GMT"*.
      For historical reasons, ECMAScript uses *"UTC"* as the primary identifier for the former Zone and does not recognize the latter Zone as distinct, instead requiring *"Etc/UTC"*, *"Etc/GMT"*, and *"GMT"* (if available) to be non-primary identifiers that resolve to *"UTC"*.
      This is the only deviation from the IANA Time Zone Database that is required of a time zone aware ECMAScript implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The IANA Time Zone Database is typically updated between five and ten times per year.
      These updates may add new Zone or Link names, may change Zones to Links, and may change the UTC offsets and transitions associated with any Zone.
      ECMAScript implementations are recommended to include updates to the IANA Time Zone Database as soon as possible.
      Such prompt action ensures that ECMAScript programs can accurately perform time-zone-sensitive calculations and can use newly-added available named time zone identifiers supplied by external input or the host environment.
    </p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>
        Although the IANA Time Zone Database maintainers strive for stability, in rare cases (averaging less than once per year) a Zone may be replaced by a new Zone.
        For example, in 2022 "*Europe/Kiev*" was deprecated to a Link resolving to a new "*Europe/Kyiv*" Zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        To reduce disruption from renaming changes, ECMAScript implementations are encouraged to initially add the new Zone as a non-primary time zone identifier that resolves to the current primary identifier.
        Then, after a waiting period, implementations are recommended to promote the new Zone to a primary time zone identifier while simultaneously demoting the deprecated name to non-primary.
        The recommended waiting period is two years after the IANA Time Zone Database release containing the changes.
        This delay allows other systems, that ECMAScript programs may interact with, to be updated to recognize the new Zone.
      </p>
      <p>
        A waiting period should only apply when a new Zone is added to replace an existing Zone.
        If an existing Zone and Link are swapped, then no waiting period is necessary.
      </p>
    </emu-note>

    <p>
      If implementations revise time zone information during the lifetime of an agent, then which identifiers are supported, the primary time zone identifier associated with any identifier, and the UTC offsets and transitions associated with any Zone, must be consistent with results previously observed by that agent.
      Due to the complexity of supporting this requirement, it is recommended that implementations maintain a fully consistent copy of the IANA Time Zone Database for the lifetime of each agent.
    </p>

    <p>This section complements but does not supersede <emu-xref href="#sec-time-zone-identifiers"></emu-xref>.</p>

    <emu-note>
      <p>
        The IANA Time Zone Database offers build options that affect which time zone identifiers are primary.
        The default build options merge different countries' time zones, for example *"Atlantic/Reykjavik"* being a Link to the Zone *"Africa/Abidjan"*.
        Geographically and politically distinct locations are likely to introduce divergent time zone rules in a future version of the IANA Time Zone Database.
        Therefore, it is recommended that ECMAScript implementations instead use build options such as <code>PACKRATDATA=backzone PACKRATLIST=zone.tab</code> or a similar alternative that ensures at least one primary identifier for each <a href="https://www.iso.org/glossary-for-iso-3166.html">ISO 3166-1 Alpha-2</a> country code.

        <emu-note>
          Time zone identifiers in the IANA Time Zone Database can change over time.
          At a minimum, implementations must limit changes to the result of AvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifiers to the changes allowed by GetAvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifier, for the lifetime of the surrounding agent.
          That is, implementations must not remove support for or change the primary vs. non-primary status of an identifier that was already reported as available, and they must not add support for an identifier that was already reported as not available.
          Due to the complexity of supporting these recommendations, it is recommended that the result of AvailableNamedTimeZoneIdentifiers remains the same for the lifetime of the surrounding agent.

      <li>[[NumberingSystem]] is a String value representing the <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/#UnicodeNumberSystemIdentifier">Unicode Number System Identifier</a> used for formatting.</li>
