      At a minimum, ECMAScript implementations must support a built-in calendar named *"iso8601"*, representing the ISO 8601 calendar.
      In addition, implementations may support any number of other built-in calendars corresponding with those of the <a href="https://cldr.unicode.org/">Unicode Common Locale Data Repository (CLDR)</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      ECMAScript implementations identify built-in calendars using a <dfn variants="calendar types">calendar type</dfn> as defined by <a href="https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35-dates.html#Calendar_Elements">Unicode Technical Standard #35, Part 4, Section 2</a>.
      Their canonical form is a string containing only Unicode Basic Latin lowercase letters (U+0061 LATIN SMALL LETTER A through U+007A LATIN SMALL LETTER Z, inclusive) and/or digits (U+0030 DIGIT ZERO through U+0039 DIGIT NINE, inclusive), with zero or more medial hyphens (U+002D HYPHEN-MINUS).

                When the number of months in a year of the calendar is variable, a different value can be returned for dates that are part of the same month in different years. For example, in the Hebrew calendar, 1 Nisan 5781 is associated with value 7 while 1 Nisan 5782 is associated with value 8 because 5782 is a leap year and Nisan follows the insertion of Adar I.

              The month code of the date's month. The month code for a month that is not a leap month and whose 1-based ordinal position in a common year of the calendar (i.e., a year that is not a leap year) is _n_ should be the string-concatenation of *"M"* and ToZeroPaddedDecimalString(_n_, 2), and the month code for a month that is a leap month inserted after a month whose 1-based ordinal position in a common year of the calendar is _p_ should be the string-concatenation of *"M"*, ToZeroPaddedDecimalString(_p_, 2), and *"L"*.
              <emu-note>
                For example, in the Hebrew calendar, the month code of Adar (and Adar II, in leap years) is *"M06"* and the month code of Adar I (the leap month inserted before Adar II) is *"M05L"*. In a calendar with a leap month at the start of some years, the month code of that month would be *"M00L"*.

                A "leap year" is a year that contains more days than other years (for solar or lunar calendars) or more months than other years (for lunisolar calendars like Hebrew or Chinese).
                Some calendars, especially lunisolar ones, have further variation in year length that is not represented in the output of this operation (e.g., the Hebrew calendar includes common years with 353, 354, or 355 days and leap years with 383, 384, or 385 days).

        An <dfn variants="Calendar Fields Records">Calendar Fields Record</dfn> is a Record value used to represent full or partial input for a calendar date in a non-ISO 8601 calendar.
        Calendar Fields Records are produced by several abstract operations, such as TemporalObjectToFields and PrepareCalendarFields, and are passed to abstract operations such as CalendarDateFromFields.
      </p>
      <p>Many of the fields in a Calendar Fields Record have the same meaning as the fields of the same name in Calendar Date Records, but each field in a Calendar Fields Record may additionally be ~unset~ to indicate partial input.</p>
      <p>
        Each field has a corresponding property key.
        These property keys correspond to the properties that are read from user input objects to populate the field, in methods such as `Temporal.PlainDate.prototype.with()`.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each field has a corresponding enumeration key.
        Lists of these enumeration keys are passed to abstract operations such as PrepareCalendarFields and ISOFieldKeysToIgnore to denote a subset of fields to operate on.

          For *"reject"*, values that do not form a valid date cause an exception to be thrown.

      <p>
        The fields of the returned ISO Date Record represent a reference date in the ISO 8601 calendar that, when converted to the built-in calendar identified by _calendar_, corresponds to the month code and day of _fields_ in an arbitrary but deterministically chosen reference year.
        The reference date is the latest ISO 8601 date corresponding to the calendar date, that is also earlier than or equal to the ISO 8601 date December 31, 1972.
        If that calendar date never occurs on or before the ISO 8601 date December 31, 1972, then the reference date is the earliest ISO 8601 date corresponding to that calendar date.
        The reference year is almost always 1972 (the first ISO 8601 leap year after the epoch), with exceptions for calendars where some dates (e.g. leap days or days in leap months) didn't occur during that ISO 8601 year. For example, Hebrew calendar leap month Adar I occurred in calendar years 5730 and 5733 (respectively overlapping ISO 8601 February/March 1970 and February/March 1973), but did not occur between them, so the reference year for days of that month is 1970.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like RegulateISODate, the operation throws a *RangeError* exception if _overflow_ is *"reject"* and the month and day described by _fields_ does not exist.
        For example, when _calendar_ is *"gregory"* and _overflow_ is *"reject"*, _fields_ values of { [[MonthCode]]: *"M01"*, [[Day]]: 32 } and { [[Year]]: 2001, [[Month]]: 2, [[Day]]: 29 } would both cause a *RangeError* to be thrown.
        In the latter case, even though February 29 is a date in leap years of the Gregorian calendar, 2001 was not a leap year and a month code cannot be determined from the nonexistent date 2001-02-29 with the specified month index.

        For example, given a _calendar_ that uses eras, such as *"gregory"*, a key in _keys_ being any one of ~year~, ~era~, or ~era-year~ would exclude all three.
        Passing any one of the three to a `with()` method might conflict with either of the other two properties on the receiver object, so those properties of the receiver object should be ignored.
        Given this, in addition to the ISO 8601 mutual exclusion of ~month~ and ~month-code~ as in ISOFieldKeysToIgnore, a possible implementation might produce the following results when _calendar_ is *"gregory"*:

      <p>The operation throws a *TypeError* exception if the fields of _fields_ are internally inconsistent within the calendar or insufficient to identify a unique instance of _type_ in the calendar. For example:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>If _type_ is ~date~ or ~month-day~ and ~day~ in the calendar has an interpretation analogous to ISO 8601 and _fields_.[[Day]] is ~unset~.</li>
        <li>If ~month~ and ~month-code~ in the calendar have interpretations analogous to ISO 8601 and either the corresponding values for both are ~unset~ or neither value is ~unset~ but they do not identify the same month.</li>
        <li>If _type_ is ~month-day~ and _fields_.[[MonthCode]] is ~unset~ and a year cannot be determined from _fields_.</li>
        <li>If _type_ is ~date~ or ~year-month~ and the calendar supports the usual partitioning of years into eras with their own year counting as represented by ~year~, ~era~, and ~era-year~ (as in the Gregorian or traditional Japanese calendars) and any of the following cases apply:
          <ul>
            <li>Each of _fields_.[[Year]], _fields_.[[Era]], and _fields_.[[EraYear]] is ~unset~.</li>
            <li>_fields_.[[Era]] is ~unset~ but _fields_.[[EraYear]] is not.</li>
            <li>_fields_.[[EraYear]] is ~unset~ but _fields_.[[Era]] is not.</li>
            <li>None of the three values are ~unset~ but _fields_.[[Era]] and _fields_.[[EraYear]] do not together identify the same year as _fields_.[[Year]].</li>

      </ul>
      <emu-note>
        When _type_ is ~month-day~ and _fields_.[[Month]] is provided without _fields_.[[MonthCode]], it is recommended that all built-in calendars other than the ISO 8601 calendar require a disambiguating year (e.g., either _fields_.[[Year]] or _fields_.[[Era]] and _fields_.[[EraYear]]), including those that always use exactly the same months as the ISO 8601 calendar (which receives special handling in this specification as a default calendar that is permanently stable for automated processing).
