## Agenda:
### NearForm podcast
- PDL: Will be live on NearForm podcast in 15 minutes, would love suggestions around what to talk about.
- PFC: I think you could talk about the polyfill and ask people to try it out and give us feedback. We should avoid people using it in production though.
- PDL: Iâ€™ll make a point about not using it in production. Once the proposal is Stage 3, I think itâ€™ll be fairly fast for at least the initial rollout and I intend to participate personally. So it can be done fairly quickly, am I wrong?
- SFC: Need to check with the V8 team. It might take a while, given that Temporal is more complicated than the standard Intl proposal.
- PDL: Thanks for the suggestions. Iâ€™ll head out.

### [#490](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/490), how `with()`/`getDate()` etc. delegate to the calendar
- PFC: This issue is fairly straightforward, it's about the mechanics of how methods like `with()`, `getDate()`, etc., delegate to the calendar. SFC's proposal is to use the `getFields()` method we agreed to add a few weeks ago to implement this.
- SFC: My impression on how that works currently is that a subset of these getters is made obsolete with `getFields()`.
- DE: What is `getFields()` for? Is it specifically for the calendar?
- PFC: It was suggested as a comment to our presentation at the plenary on whether the fields should be enumerable. `getFields()` is what you use if you need an object with enumerable own properties.
- SFC: If we have agreement on this, I will make a PR adding this method to the calendar draft.

### [#428](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/428), design of parsing methods
- PFC: This is a question we've discussed several times. I made a draft about some alternatives, if people haven't had a chance to read it we could defer this until later, or we could try to get consensus on this.
- SFC: Iâ€™d like to defer this to people who have been more thoroughly involved in the parse method.
- RGN: I havenâ€™t had the chance to look at this, but I could do that soon-ish.
- PFC: While this is a hole in the specification currently, itâ€™s certainly not blocking anything else.
- RGN: Thatâ€™s a fair assessment, thanks.
- PFC: Or we could work on implementing one of those and take it from there.
- SFC: Do you have the pros and cons listed out?
- PFC: Not in the current draft, no. Iâ€™ll add them in. Basically alternative 1 prioritizes the "parsing ISO" use case with from() and the "parsing parts" uses `Temporal.parse()`. Alternative 2 prioritizes "parsing parts" with `from()` and to get the ISO semantics you need to use `Temporal.parse()`. Alternative 3 I don't like because it's a mix, although it does make `Temporal.parse()` obsolete.
- SFC: Iâ€™ll try to form a stronger opinion on this discussion.
- RGN: My preference is mostly aligned with yours. There are questions about what to do when validation fails, but mostly weâ€™re on the same page.
- PFC: Good to know.

### [#294](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-temporal/issues/294), `idToCalendar`/`idToTimeZone`
- PFC: This issue is about custom calendars and time zones. If you need to resolve a string ID to a custom calendar or time zone, what's a good API for that? The `idToCalendar`/`idToTimeZone` is not super convenient, but it does avoid mutable global state. Some sort of registry would be more convenient but would be global state.
- USA: Why not references instead of IDs?
- SFC: Because itâ€™s easier to send IDs over the wire, and serialize them and store them in a database. Itâ€™s harder for objects. The exact calendar comes from either a location in an interchange format. Therefore, we need to support objects, but strings are important for this reason. Another important reason is polyfillability.
- DE: Having a registry would be a global communication channel.
- RGN: I donâ€™t see how thatâ€™s any more vulnerable than a global object.
- DE: The idea is that we shouldnâ€™t have global state in slots, I really like how JHD worded it.
- RGN: I think I agree.
- SFC: Thereâ€™s a few things. Say youâ€™re polyfilling `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`, you can just add it. It fills in holes in the namespace. Makes it super easy to polyfill calendars into browsers. If youâ€™re doing something completely different, you wonâ€™t do it on the Intl namespace, you will probably do it on your own namespace, which would make string conversion hard.
- PFC: If you donâ€™t want to expose timezone data the host knows about, then you probably donâ€™t want to reveal the calendars either, so youâ€™d probably patch it to just expose ISO.
- RGN: It doesnâ€™t feel analogous to adding `Intl.RelativeTimeFormat`. Itâ€™s more like adding a locale. Itâ€™s less about filling holes and more about patching existing functionality.
- SFC: Does anyone have other, elegant proposals?
- DE: Since we also have user-specified time-zones, are we using the same approach there as well?
- SFC: I actually left a comment on PFCâ€™s pull request about it. We should ideally use a similar approach there.
- DE: When to convert an ID to calendar, it would create a new calendar. The registry would just return the same objects, which would be different perf-wise.
- SFC: The registry idea wouldnâ€™t work without frozen calendars.
- DE: It doesnâ€™t need to be so, not really.
- RGN: I like the analogy to Intl, and I do like that theyâ€™re dealt with similarly. I also like the polyfillability angle. However, I cannot come up with a counter-proposal.
- DE: Whatâ€™s the angle on the polyfillability argument?
- RGN: Adding a single calendar would require a mountain for work, which defeats the purpose.
- DE: Thereâ€™s nothing like this in Intl. The subclass-ability, registry approach, etc.
- SFC, RGN: Weâ€™ve not had to deal with those problems.
- DE: The problem is: I fail to see the use-case here apart from partial implementations?
- PFC: One of the use-cases for custom time-zones is that if you wanted to do date-time arithmetic before time-zones were standardized.
- DE: In case of out-of-date implementations, we could redirect the user to the polyfill.
- SFC: The approach of nuking the existing builtins completely feels awkward to me. You want the ability to patch single calendars or time-zones without getting rid of all the rest.
- DE: The problem is, there are alternative solutions for all of these things.
- SFC: Thatâ€™s why I proposed two things, theyâ€™re on either side of the spectrum.
- DE: I think thereâ€™s a cost of all this indirection. My point is, we should have a smaller surface area. The problem is, the stuff around custom calendars and timezones keeps getting more and more complicated and I donâ€™t feel that this is good enough justification.
- SFC: I now see DEâ€™s point, and I see the connection to Intl. A lot of people built wrappers on top of Intl to deal with the fact that Intl doesnâ€™t have the ability to add data. The difference here is that Temporal is sort of a fundamental data type. Maybe we could move Timezones and Calendars out of Temporal and into a more data-driven namespace.
- DE: Itâ€™s a rather interesting observation. I wonder what else breaks without the existence of the Temporal object.
- PFC: Any conclusions? Letâ€™s continue on the thread, but unify the discussion. Letâ€™s discuss both TimeZones and Calendars.
- SFC: Now I see the connection between this and [ecma402 #210](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/210) (data provider). Itâ€™s nice that DE picked it up.
- DE: I thought you were working on this because of [#210](https://github.com/tc39/ecma402/issues/210) ðŸ˜…
- SFC: If Calendar had a `from()` and if we made everything use that, we could make that static a sort of global ID to calendar method.
- Everyone agrees that reusing `from()` would be a nice idea.
